## 📖 Introduction

**Skills Manager** is a modern desktop application designed to solve the fragmentation of AI assistant skills configurations. Instead of managing skills and prompts separately for different tools, Skills Manager provides a central hub.

It uses a powerful **symlink synchronization mechanism**, allowing you to write a skill once and instantly use it across supported AI tools like Claude Code, Codex, Opencode.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Unified Management**: Centralize all your AI skills in one secure location.
- **🔄 Smart Synchronization**: Automatic symlink management ensures your tools always have the latest version of your skills without file duplication.
- **🎛️ Granular Control**: Enable or disable specific skills for individual tools without deleting the original files.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Built with **Rust** and **Tauri 2.0** for a lightweight, blazing-fast experience.
- **🛡️ Cross-Platform**: Native support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **🔌 Multi-Tool Support**: Out-of-the-box support for **Claude Code, Codex, Opencode** and extensible to others.
- **🧩 Custom Tools**: Add your own tools with custom paths and optional icons.
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Beautiful interface built with React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Radix UI.

## 📥 Download

Download the latest installer for your operating system from the **[Releases Page](../../releases)**.

| OS | Installer Type |
|----|----------------|
| **macOS** | `.dmg` (Universal) |
| **Windows** | `.msi` / `.exe` |
| **Linux** | `.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.rpm`|

## ⚠️ Windows Important Note

If you encounter permission issues when syncing skills (symbolic link creation errors) or detection issues, please try running the application as **Administrator**. This is often required on Windows to create symbolic links unless Developer Mode is enabled.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install**: Run the installer for your platform.
2. **Setup**: On first launch, the app will guide you to select your skills storage directory.
3. **Sync**: The app automatically detects installed AI tools (like Claude Code) and links your skills.

## ❗ Linux Troubleshooting

If you encounter a **blank white screen** when launching the `.AppImage` on Linux (especially in virtual machines like VMware/VirtualBox), it is likely a WebKitGTK hardware acceleration issue.

Please run the application from the terminal with the following command:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 ./Skills-Manager_1.0.1_amd64.AppImage
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Designed for developers who care about performance and stability:

- **Core**: [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app/) (Rust)
